            A StreamLabel is a 32 bit integer that represents a position in a IStreamReader or
            IStreamWriter. During writing it is generated by the IStreamWriter.GetLabel method an
            consumed by the IStreamWriter.WriteLabel method. On reading you can use
            IStreamReader.Current and and IStreamReader.

            Sometimes information is only known after writing the entire stream.  This information can be put
            on the end of the stream, but there needs to be a way of finding it relative to the end, rather
            than from the beginning.   A IStreamReader, however, does not actually let you go 'backwards' easily
            because it does not guarantee the size what it writes out (it might compress).  
            
            The solution is the concept of a 'suffixLabel' which is location in the stream where you can always 
            efficiently get to.
            
            It is written with a special API (WriteSuffixLabel that must be the last thing written.   It is 
            expected that it simply write an uncompressed StreamLabel.   It can then be used by using the
            GotoSTreamLabel() method below.   This goes to this well know position in the stream.   We expect
            this is implemented by seeking to the end of the stream, reading the uncompressed streamLabel, 
            and then seeking to that position.

            The Serializer class is a general purpose object graph serializer helper. While it does not have
            any knowledge of the serialization format of individual object, it does impose conventions on how to
            serialize support information like the header (which holds versioning information), a trailer (which
            holds deferred pointer information), and how types are versioned. However these conventions are
            intended to be very generic and thus this class can be used for essentially any serialization need.
            
            Goals:
                * Allows full range of serialization, including subclassing and cyclic object graphs.
                * Can be serialized and deserialized efficiently sequentially (no seeks MANDATED on read or
                    write). This allows the serializer to be used over pipes and other non-seekable devices).
                * Pay for play (thus very efficient in simple cases (no subclassing or cyclic graphs).
                * Ideally self-describing, and debuggable (output as XML if desired?)
            
            Versioning:
                * We want the ability for new formats to accept old versions if objects wish to support old
                    formats
                * Also wish to allow new formats to be read by OLD version if the new format is just an
                    'extension' (data added to end of objects). This makes making new versions almost pain-free.
                    
            Concepts:
                * No-seek requirement
                
                    The serialized form should be such that it can be deserialized efficiently in a serial fashion
                    (no seeks). This means all information needed to deserialize has to be 'just in time' (can't
                    be some table at the end). Pragmatically this means that type information (needed to create
                    instances), has to be output on first use, so it is available for the deserializer.
                    
                * Laziness requirement
                
                    While is should be possible to read the serialized for sequentially, we should also not force
                    it. It should be possible to have a large file that represents a persisted structure that can
                    be lazily brought into memory on demand. This means that all information needed to
                    deserialize must also be 'randomly available' and not depend on reading from the beginning.
                    Pragmatically this means that type information, and forward forwardReference information needs to
                    have a table in a well known Location at the end so that it can be found without having to
                    search the file sequentially.
                
                * Versioning requirement
                    
                    To allow OLD code to access NEW formats, it must be the case that the serialized form of
                    every instance knows how to 'skip' past any new data (even if it does not know its exact
                    size). To support this, objects have 'begin' and 'end' tags, which allows the deserializer to
                    skip the next object.
                    
                * Polymorphism requirement
                
                    Because the user of a filed may not know the exact instance stored there, in general objects
                    need to store the exact type of the instance. Thus they need to store a type identifier, this
                    can be folded into the 'begin' tag.
                    
                * Arbitrary object graph (circularity) requirement (Forward references)
                
                    The serializer needs to be able to serialize arbitrary object graphs, including those with
                    cycles in them. While you can do this without forward references, the system is more flexible
                    if it has the concept of a forward reference. Thus whenever a object reference is required, a
                    'forward forwardReference' can be given instead. What gets serialized is simply an unique forward
                    reference index (index into an array), and at some later time that index is given its true
                    value. This can either happen with the target object is serialized (see
                    Serializer.Tags.ForwardDefintion) or at the end of the serialization in a forward
                    reference table (which allows forward references to be resolved without scanning then entire
                    file.
                    
                * Contract between objects IFastSerializable.ToStream:
                
                    The heart of the serialization and deserialization process the IFastSerializable
                    interface, which implements just two methods: ToStream (for serializing an object), and
                    FromStream (for deserializing and object). This interfaces is the mechanism by which objects
                    tell the serializer what data to store for an individual instance. However this core is not
                    enough. An object that implements IFastSerializable must also implement a default
                    constructor (constructor with no args), so that that deserializer can create the object (and
                    then call FromStream to populated it).
                    
                    The ToStream method is only responsible for serializing the data in the object, and by itself
                    is not sufficient to serialize an interconnected, polymorphic graph of objects. It needs
                    help from the Serializer and Deserialize to do this. Serializer takes on the
                    responsibility to deal with persisting type information (so that Deserialize can create
                    the correct type before IFastSerializable.FromStream is called). It is also the
                    serializer's responsibility to provide the mechanism for dealing with circular object graphs
                    and forward references.
                
                * Layout of a serialized object: A serialized object has the following basic format
                
                    * If the object is the definition of a previous forward references, then the definition must
                        begin with a Serializer.Tags.ForwardDefintion tag followed by a forward forwardReference
                        index which is being defined.
                    * Serializer.Tags.BeginObject tag
                    * A reference to the SerializationType for the object. This reference CANNOT be a
                        forward forwardReference because its value is needed during the deserialization process before
                        forward references are resolved.
                    * All the data that that objects 'IFastSerializable.ToStream method wrote. This is the
                        heart of the deserialized data, and the object itself has a lot of control over this
                        format.
                    * Serializer.Tags.EndObject tag. This marks the end of the object. It quickly finds bugs
                        in ToStream FromStream mismatches, and also allows for V1 deserializers to skip past
                        additional fields added since V1.
                    
                * Serializing Object references:
                  When an object forwardReference is serialized, any of the following may follow in the stream
                  
                    * Serializer.Tags.NullReference used to encode a null object forwardReference.
                    * Serializer.Tags.BeginObject or Serializer.Tags.ForwardDefintion, which indicates
                        that this the first time the target object has been referenced, and the target is being
                        serialized on the spot.
                    * Serializer.Tags.ObjectReference which indicates that the target object has already
                        been serialized and what follows is the StreamLabel of where the definition is.
                    * Serializer.Tags.ForwardReference followed by a new forward forwardReference index. This
                        indicates that the object is not yet serialized, but the serializer has chosen not to
                        immediately serialize the object. Ultimately this object will be defined, but has not
                        happened yet.
                       
                * Serializing Types:
                  Types are simply objects of type SerializationType which contain enough information about
                  the type for the Deserializer to do its work (it full name and version number).   They are
                  serialized just like all other types.  The only thing special about it is that references to
                  types after the BeginObject tag must not be forward references.  
             
            #StreamLayout:
                The structure of the file as a whole is simply a list of objects.  The first and last objects in
                the file are part of the serialization infrastructure.

            To tune working set (or disk seeks), or to make the dump of the format more readable, it is
            valuable to have control over which of several references to an object will actually cause it to
            be serialized (by default the first encountered does it).
            
            WriteDefered allows you to write just a forwardReference to an object with the expectation that
            somewhere later in the serialization process the object will be serialized. If no call to
            WriteObject() occurs, then the object is serialized automatically before the stream is closed
            (thus dangling references are impossible).

            This is an optimized version of WriteObjectReference that can be used in some cases.
            
            If the object is not aliased (it has an 'owner' and only that owner has references to it (which
            implies its lifetime is strictly less than its owners), then the serialization system does not
            need to put the object in the 'interning' table. This saves a space (entries in the intern table
            as well as 'SyncEntry' overhead of creating hash codes for object) as well as time (to create
            that bookkeeping) for each object that is treated as private (which can add up if because it is
            common that many objects are private).  The private instances are also marked in the serialized
            format so on reading there is a similar bookkeeping savings. 
            
            The ultimate bits written by WritePrivateObject are the same as WriteObject.

            A DeferedRegion help make 'lazy' objects. You will have a DeferedRegion for each block of object you
            wish to independently decide whether to deserialize lazily (typically you have one per object however
            in the limit you can have one per field, it is up to you).
            
            When you call DeferedRegion.Write you give it a delegate that will write all the deferred fields.
            The Write operation will place a forward reference in the stream that skips all the fields written,
            then the fields themselves, then define the forward reference. This allows readers to skip the
            deferred fields.
            
            When you call DeferedRegion.Read  you also give it a delegate that reads all the deferred fields.
            However when 'Read' instead of reading the fields it
            
                * remembers the deserializer, stream position, and reading delegate.
                * it uses the forward reference to skip the region.
                
            When DeferedRegion.FinishRead is called, it first checks if the region was already restored. 
            If not it used the information to read in the deferred region and returns.  Thus this FinishRead
            should be called before any deferred field is used.

             At some point typically you give up allowing new versions of the read to read old wire formats
             This is the Minimum version of the serialized data that this reader can deserialize.   Trying
             to read wire formats strictly smaller (older) than this will fail.   Setting this to the current
             version indicates that you don't care about ever reading data generated with an older version
             of the code.  
             
             If you set this to something other than your current version, you are obligated to insure that
             your FromStream() method can handle all formats >= than this number. 
            
             You can achieve this if you simply use the 'WriteTagged' and 'ReadTagged' APIs in your 'ToStream' 
             and 'FromStream' after your V1 AND you always add new fields to the end of your class.   
             This is the best practice.   Thus  
             
                 void IFastSerializable.ToStream(Serializer serializer)

                     // ...
                     serializer.WriteTagged(Ver_2_Field1);   
                     serializer.WriteTagged(Ver_2_Field2);
                     // ...
                     serializer.WriteTagged(Ver_3_Field1);
                 }
             
                 void IFastSerializable.FromStream(Deserializer deserializer)
                 {
                     deserializer.Read(out Ver_1_Field1);
                     deserializer.Read(out Ver_1_Field2);
                     // ...
                     deserializer.TryReadTagged(ref Ver_2_Field1);  // If data no present (old format) then Ver_2_Field1 not set.
                     deserializer.TryReadTagged(ref Ver_2_Field2);  // ditto...
                     // ...
                     deserializer.TryReadTagged(ref Ver_3_Field1);    
                 } 
             
             Tagging outputs a byte tag in addition to the field itself.   If that is a problem you can also use the
             VersionBeingRead to find out what format is being read and write code that explicitly handles it.  
             Note however that this only gets you Backward compatibility (new readers can read the old format, but old readers 
             will still not be able to read the new format), which is why this is not the preferred method.

            Returns true if the Growable array was initialized by the default constructor
            which has no capacity (and thus will cause growth on the first addition).
            This method allows you to lazily set the compacity of your GrowableArray by
            testing if it is of EmtpyCapacity, and if so set it to some useful capacity.
            This avoids unecessary reallocs to get to a reasonable capacity.
